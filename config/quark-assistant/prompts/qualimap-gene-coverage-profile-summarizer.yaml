      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "QualiMap: Gene Coverage Profile" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:

             4. Section: Gene Coverage Profile
             5. Section description: <p>Mean distribution of coverage depth across the length of all mapped transcripts.</p>
             6. Section help text: <p>There are currently three main approaches to map reads to transcripts in an RNA-seq experiment: mapping reads to a reference genome to identify expressed transcripts that are annotated (and discover those that are unknown), mapping reads to a reference transcriptome, and <i>de novo</i> assembly of transcript sequences (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8" target="_blank">Conesa et al. 2016</a>).</p>  
               <p>For RNA-seq QC analysis, QualiMap can be used to assess alignments produced by the first of these approaches. For input, it requires a GTF annotation file along with a reference genome, which can be used to reconstruct the exon structure of known transcripts. QualiMap uses this information to calculate the depth of coverage along the length of each annotated transcript. For a set of reads mapped to a transcript, the depth of coverage at a given base position is the number of high-quality reads that map to the transcript at that position (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3642" target="_blank">Sims et al. 2014</a>).</p>  
               <p>QualiMap calculates coverage depth at every base position of each annotated transcript. To enable meaningful comparison between transcripts, base positions are rescaled to relative positions expressed as percentage distance along each transcript (<em>0%, 1%, ..., 99%</em>). For the set of transcripts with at least one mapped read, QualiMap plots the <em>cumulative mapped-read depth</em> (y-axis) at each relative transcript position (x-axis). This plot shows the gene coverage profile across all mapped transcripts for each read dataset. It provides a visual way to assess positional biases, such as an accumulation of mapped reads at the 3′ end of transcripts, which may indicate poor RNA quality in the original sample (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8" target="_blank">Conesa et al. 2016</a>).</p>  
               <p>The <em>Normalised</em> plot is calculated by MultiQC to enable comparison of samples with varying sequencing depth. The <em>cumulative mapped-read depth</em> at each position across the averaged transcript position is divided by the total for that sample across the entire averaged transcript.</p>
