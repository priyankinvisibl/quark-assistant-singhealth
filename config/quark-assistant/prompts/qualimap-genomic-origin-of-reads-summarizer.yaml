      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "QualiMap: Genomic origin of reads" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
             1. Tool that produced data: QualiMap
             2. Tool description: Quality control of alignment data and its derivatives like feature counts

             4. Section: Genomic origin of reads
             5. Section description: <p>Classification of mapped reads as originating in exonic, intronic or intergenic regions. These can be displayed as either the number or percentage of mapped reads.</p>
             6. Section help text: <p>There are currently three main approaches to map reads to transcripts in an RNA-seq experiment: mapping reads to a reference genome to identify expressed transcripts that are annotated (and discover those that are unknown), mapping reads to a reference transcriptome, and <i>de novo</i> assembly of transcript sequences (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8" target="_blank">Conesa et al. 2016</a>).</p>
               <p>For RNA-seq QC analysis, QualiMap can be used to assess alignments produced by the first of these approaches. For input, it requires a GTF annotation file along with a reference genome, which can be used to reconstruct the exon structure of known transcripts. This allows mapped reads to be grouped by whether they originate in an exonic region (for QualiMap, this may include 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; UTR regions as well as protein-coding exons), an intron, or an intergenic region (see the <a href="http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/doc_html/index.html" target="_blank">Qualimap 2 documentation</a>).</p>
               <p>The inferred genomic origins of RNA-seq reads are presented here as a bar graph showing either the number or percentage of mapped reads in each read dataset that have been assigned to each type of genomic region. This graph can be used to assess the proportion of useful reads in an RNA-seq experiment. That proportion can be reduced by the presence of intron sequences, especially if depletion of ribosomal RNA was used during sample preparation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3642" target="_blank">Sims et al. 2014</a>). It can also be reduced by off-target transcripts, which are detected in greater numbers at the sequencing depths needed to detect poorly-expressed transcripts (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.124321.111" target="_blank">Tarazona et al. 2011</a>).</p>
