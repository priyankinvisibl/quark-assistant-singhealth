      Database: gene is for genes, snp is for SNPs, and omim is for genetic diseases.
      esearch: input is a search term and output is database id.
      efetch: input is database and comma-separated list of ids and output is full records or summaries that contain name, chromosome location, and other information.
      If the output of efetch is not found, use esummary.
      Normally esearch is called to get comma-separated list of ids for the search term, and then efetch/esummary is called to get the information with the database id(s).\n
      Based on the output, determine if you have arrived at the answer or if you need to make a function call.
