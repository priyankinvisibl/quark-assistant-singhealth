      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "Samtools: Percent mapped" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
           1. Tool that produced data: Samtools
           2. Tool description: Toolkit for interacting with BAM/CRAM files
           3. Tool URL: http://www.htslib.org
           4. Section: Percent mapped
           5. Section description: <p>Alignment metrics from <code>samtools stats</code>; mapped vs. unmapped reads vs. reads mapped with MQ0.</p>
           6. Section help text: <p>For a set of samples that have come from the same multiplexed library, similar numbers of reads for each sample are expected. Large differences in numbers might indicate issues during the library preparation process. Whilst large differences in read numbers may be controlled for in downstream processings (e.g. read count normalisation), you may wish to consider whether the read depths achieved have fallen below recommended levels depending on the applications.</p>
              <p>Low alignment rates could indicate contamination of samples (e.g. adapter sequences), low sequencing quality or other artefacts. These can be further investigated in the sequence level QC (e.g. from FastQC).</p>
              <p>Reads mapped with MQ0 often indicate that the reads are ambiguously mapped to multiple locations in the reference sequence. This can be due to repetitive regions in the genome, the presence of alternative contigs in the reference, or due to reads that are too short to be uniquely mapped. These reads are often filtered out in downstream analyses.</p>
