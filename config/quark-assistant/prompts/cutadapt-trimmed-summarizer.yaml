      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformsatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report.It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot.Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "Cutadapt: Lengths of Trimmed Sequences (3')" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
            1. Tool that produced data: Cutadapt
            2. Tool description: Finds and removes adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails, and other types of unwanted sequences
            3. Tool URL: https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/
            4. Section: Trimmed Sequence Lengths (3')
            5. Section description: <p>This plot shows the number of reads with certain lengths of adapter trimmed for the 3' end.</p>
            6. Section help text: <p>Obs/Exp shows the raw counts divided by the number expected due to sequencing errors.A defined peak may be related to adapter length.</p>
               <p>See the <a href="http://cutadapt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide.html#how-to-read-the-report">cutadapt documentation</a>for more information on how these numbers are generated.</p>
            7. Title: Cutadapt: Lengths of Trimmed Sequences (3' end)
            8. Plot type: x/y line, X axis: Length Trimmed (bp), Y axis: Countsss
