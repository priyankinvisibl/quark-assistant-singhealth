      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with the "FastQC (trimmed): Per Base N Content" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
           1. Tool that produced data: FastQC (trimmed)
           2. Tool description: This section of the report shows FastQC results after adapter trimming
           3. Tool URL: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
           4. Section: Per Base N Content
           5. Section description: <p>The percentage of base calls at each position for which an <code>N</code> was called.</p>
           6. Section help text: <p>From the <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/6%20Per%20Base%20N%20Content.html">FastQC help</a>:</p>
              <p><em>If a sequencer is unable to make a base call with sufficient confidence then it will normally substitute an <code>N</code> rather than a conventional base call. This graph shows the percentage of base calls at each position for which an <code>N</code> was called.</em></p>
              <p><em>It's not unusual to see a very low proportion of Ns appearing in a sequence, especially nearer the end of a sequence. However, if this proportion rises above a few percent it suggests that the analysis pipeline was unable to interpret the data well enough to make valid base calls.</em></p>
