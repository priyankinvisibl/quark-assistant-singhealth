      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics
      into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across
      all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables,
      as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "FastQC (trimmed): Per Sequence Quality Scores" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
           1. Tool that produced data: FastQC (trimmed)
           2. Tool description: This section of the report shows FastQC results after adapter trimming
           3. Tool URL: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
           4. Section: Per Sequence Quality Scores
           5. Section description: <p>The number of reads with average quality scores. Shows if a subset of reads has poor quality.</p>
           6. Section help text: <p>From the <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/3%20Per%20Sequence%20Quality%20Scores.html">FastQC help</a>:</p>
              <p><em>The per sequence quality score report allows you to see if a subset of your sequences have universally low quality values. It is often the case that a subset of sequences will have universally poor quality, however these should represent only a small percentage of the total sequences.</em></p>
