      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "Fastp: N content" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
           1. Tool that produced data: Fastp
           2. Tool description: Evaluates high throughput RNA-seq data
           3. Tool URL: https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp
           4. Section: N content
           6. Title: Fastp: N content
           7. Plot type: xy line
