      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "FastQC (raw): Adapter Content" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
      Tool that produced data: FastQC (raw)
           1. Tool description: This section of the report shows FastQC results before adapter trimming
           2. Tool URL: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
           3. Section: Adapter Content
           4. Section description: <p>The cumulative percentage count of the proportion of your library which has seen each of the adapter sequences at each position.</p>
           5. Section help text: <p>Note that only samples with >= 0.1% adapter contamination are shown.</p>
              <p>There may be several lines per sample, as one is shown for each adapter detected in the file.</p>
              <p>From the <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/10%20Adapter%20Content.html">FastQC Help</a>:</p>
              <p><em>The plot shows a cumulative percentage count of the proportion of your library which has seen each of the adapter sequences at each position. Once a sequence has been seen in a read it is counted as being present right through to the end of the read so the percentages you see will only increase as the read length goes on.</em></p>
           6. Title: FastQC: Adapter Content
           7. Plot type: x/y line, X axis: Position (bp), Y axis: % of Sequences
