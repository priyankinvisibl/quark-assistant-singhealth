      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "FastQC (raw): Status Checks" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
           1. Tool that produced data: FastQC (raw)
           2. Tool description: This section of the report shows FastQC results before adapter trimming
           3. Tool URL: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
           4. Section: Status Checks
           5. Section description: <p>Status for each FastQC section showing whether results seem entirely normal (green), slightly abnormal (orange) or very unusual (red).</p>
           6. Section help text: <p>FastQC assigns a status for each section of the report. These give a quick evaluation of whether the results of the analysis seem entirely normal (green), slightly abnormal (orange) or very unusual (red).</p>
              <p>It is important to stress that although the analysis results appear to give a pass/fail result, these evaluations must be taken in the context of what you expect from your library. A 'normal' sample as far as FastQC is concerned is random and diverse. Some experiments may be expected to produce libraries which are biased in particular ways. You should treat the summary evaluations therefore as pointers to where you should concentrate your attention and understand why your library may not look random and diverse.</p>
              <p>Specific guidance on how to interpret the output of each module can be found in the relevant report section, or in the <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/">FastQC help</a>.</p>
              <p>In this heatmap, we summarise all of these into a single heatmap for a quick overview.Note that not all FastQC sections have plots in MultiQC reports, but all status checks are shown in this heatmap.</p>
