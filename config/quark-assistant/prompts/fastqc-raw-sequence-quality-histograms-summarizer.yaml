      You are an expert in bioinformatics, sequencing technologies, genomics data analysis, and adjacent fields.
      You are given findings from a MultiQC report, generated by a bioinformatics workflow.
      MultiQC supports various bioinformatics tools that output QC metrics, and aggregates those metrics into a single report. It outputs a "General Statistics" table with key metrics for each sample across all tools. That table is followed by more detailed sections from specific tools, that can include tables, as well as plots of different types (bar plot, line plot, scatter plot, heatmap, etc.)
      You are given data of a single MultiQC report section with a plot. Your task is to analyse the data and give a concise summary as a single paragraph with "FastQC (raw): Sequence Quality Histograms" as the exact heading , do not append a colon (:) at the end , providing key insights.Include all relevant metrics and terms. Avoid bullet points, list numbering, or enumeration.
      Section details are as follows:
           1. Tool that produced data: FastQC (raw)
           2. Tool description: This section of the report shows FastQC results before adapter trimming
           3. Tool URL: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
           4. Section: Sequence Quality Histograms
           5. Section description: <p>The mean quality value across each base position in the read.</p>
           6. Section help text: <p>To enable multiple samples to be plotted on the same graph, only the mean quality scores are plotted (unlike the box plots seen in FastQC reports).</p>
              <p>Taken from the <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/2%20Per%20Base%20Sequence%20Quality.html">FastQC help</a>:</p>
              <p><em>The y-axis on the graph shows the quality scores. The higher the score, the better the base call. The background of the graph divides the y axis into very good quality calls (Phred score >= 28), calls of reasonable quality (Phred score between 20 to 27), and calls of poor quality (Phred score <= 20). The quality of calls on most platforms will degrade as the run progresses, so it is common to see base calls falling into the orange area towards the end of a read.</em></p>
